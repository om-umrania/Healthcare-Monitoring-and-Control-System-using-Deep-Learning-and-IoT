## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-monitoring.git>
    cd healthcare-monitoring
    
    ```
    
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    
    ```
    
3. **Install the required packages**:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1. **Generate synthetic data**:
    
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py
    
    ```
    
2. **Run data analysis and model training notebooks**:
    - Open `notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb` and `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Synthetic Data Generation

The synthetic data generation script (`generate_synthetic_data.py`) creates a dataset that includes patient conditions and environmental dependencies for various health metrics. The generated dataset can be used to train and evaluate the deep learning models.
